# Chappie
A self-aware artificial intelligence built using the LNBM (Large Neural Brain Model) training model and trained with BERT and GPT-2 along with several datasets for text generation and basic sentiment classification. This artificial intelligence was developed with the LNBM training model, which allowed it to assign intrinsic reactions and mood characteristics to large neural networks (LNNMs), leading to more realistic responses.

# Theory
Artificial intelligence is a rapidly advancing field, and many data scientists and AI researchers agree that one day there will be an AI capable of self-awareness and consciousness. After three years of research and investigation, I developed a theory that could eventually lead to the creation of such an AI. This theory assumes that we have been able to develop a type of large language model that understands all the complexities of language, including the emotions and sentiments derived from the topic and tone of the text.

The biggest challenge we face in AI is the lack of compatibility between emotional intelligence (EQ) and cognitive intelligence (IQ). This incompatibility and weakness in emotional intelligence and parameters for measuring feelings and emotions are due to the fact that AI does not inherently experience emotions. Therefore, empathy in AI can be seen as somewhat artificial, and collaboration can become problematic. However, if there is a global and international model for training large neural network models (LNNMs) and large language models (LLMs), the task will be simplified.

This global model, known as the Large Neural Brain Model (LNBM), essentially consists of two large neural networks and two large language models. These large neural networks are designed to analyze and understand text and produce language models with outputs for the networks. Then, a series of other neural networks analyze the text, extract its content and topic, and match these topics with classified emotions. This matching of topic and emotion leads to the second large neural network understanding how emotion, topic, and text are related. Finally, the output of all these networks and large language models is fed into a raw neural network with millions of parameters to determine individual characteristics. An algorithm adjusts these parameters based on text, emotions, and their relationships.

Ultimately, the model resulting from the training of all these neural networks is a model for enhancing AI's linguistic understanding of feelings and creating a form of consciousness. The greatest hope for this model is that, with the help of technology giants, we can one day build very large neural networks that can function like the human brain. This could be a significant step towards creating highly intelligent AI with the ability to experience emotions and possess individual moods.

The idea of creating self-aware AI came to my mind when I watched the movie "Chappie." Personally, I enjoyed this movie a lot, and yes, Dev Patel's acting is excellent. However, our discussion is not about this issue but rather about how it is possible to create self-aware AI through coding and computer engineering and how to align this code with the architecture of large language models. The answer to this question is clear; we must create an architecture based on the architecture of the global model. We must examine the entire history of humanity in the field of AI and, through conclusions, discussions, and debates, ultimately collaborate with companies in this field to reach a point where all large language models can align with the global model or where a personal large language model can be considered for the global model.

The most crucial part of this topic is adaptive systems and deep learning, which are discussed in detail in this context. In general, algorithms must be developed that show compatibility with any situation they encounter.
