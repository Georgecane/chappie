# Chappie Training Fix Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve training issues in the Chappie AI model codebase. The original training was failing with tensor type errors and memory issues on NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 GPU.

## Original Issues Identified

### 1. Primary Training Error
```
Error during training step: EnhancedChappie.forward() got an unexpected keyword argument 'idx'
```
**Root Cause**: The dataset contains additional fields (like `idx`) that were being passed directly to the model's forward method, but the model didn't expect them.

### 2. Tensor Type Conversion Error
```
Error during training step: only integer tensors of a single element can be converted to an index
```
**Root Cause**: Improper handling of tensor data types in the data preprocessing pipeline.

### 3. CUDA Out of Memory Error
```
CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 1.50 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 3.81 GiB
```
**Root Cause**: The default configuration was too memory-intensive for the GTX 1650's 3.81 GB VRAM.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Data Pipeline Fixes

#### A. Batch Filtering (`trainer.py`)
```python
def filter_batch_for_model(batch):
    """Filter batch to only include arguments expected by the model."""
    expected_keys = {'input_ids', 'attention_mask', 'labels', 'sentence', 'label'}
    return {k: v for k, v in batch.items() if k in expected_keys}
```

#### B. Tensor Type Handling
- Added proper tensor dtype conversion in the training loop
- Ensured `input_ids`, `attention_mask`, and `labels` are converted to `torch.long`
- Added robust device transfer with error handling

#### C. Custom Collate Function
```python
def collate_fn(batch):
    """Custom collate function to ensure proper tensor types."""
    batch_dict = {}
    for key in keys:
        if key in ['input_ids', 'attention_mask', 'labels']:
            batch_dict[key] = torch.tensor([item[key] for item in batch], dtype=torch.long)
        else:
            batch_dict[key] = [item[key] for item in batch]
    return batch_dict
```

### 2. Model Architecture Fixes

#### A. Forward Method Robustness (`model.py`)
```python
def forward(self, input_ids=None, attention_mask=None, labels=None, sentence=None, label=None, **kwargs):
    # Handle alternative field names from datasets
    if sentence is not None and input_ids is None:
        input_ids = sentence
    if label is not None and labels is None:
        labels = label
    
    # Validate required inputs
    if input_ids is None:
        raise ValueError("input_ids is required but not provided")
    if attention_mask is None:
        attention_mask = torch.ones_like(input_ids)
```

#### B. Error Handling Improvements
- Added safe tensor device transfer with fallback to CPU
- Improved exception handling in tensor conversion
- Added validation for required model inputs

### 3. Memory Optimization

#### A. GTX 1650 Optimized Configuration (`config_gtx1650.yaml`)
```yaml
# Memory-efficient settings for GTX 1650 (3.81 GB VRAM)
per_device_train_batch_size: 4      # Reduced from 16
per_device_eval_batch_size: 8       # Optimized for evaluation
gradient_accumulation_steps: 4      # Maintain effective batch size of 16
state_size: 128                     # Reduced from 256
num_emotions: 4                     # Reduced from 8
reflect_layers: 1                   # Reduced from 2
memory_size: 256                    # Reduced from 512
num_decisions: 2                    # Reduced from 4
cnn_filters: 64                     # Reduced from 128
cnn_kernels: [3, 4]                # Reduced from [3, 4, 5]
fp16: true                         # Essential for memory efficiency
```

#### B. Memory Management Features
```python
def clear_memory():
    """Clear GPU memory cache."""
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        torch.cuda.empty_cache()
    gc.collect()

# Added gradient checkpointing
if hasattr(model.backbone, 'gradient_checkpointing_enable'):
    model.backbone.gradient_checkpointing_enable()
    
# Periodic memory cleanup during training
if step % 100 == 0:
    clear_memory()
```

#### C. Out-of-Memory Recovery
```python
except RuntimeError as e:
    if "out of memory" in str(e).lower():
        logger.error(f"CUDA out of memory at step {step}: {e}")
        logger.info("Clearing GPU cache and skipping batch...")
        clear_memory()
        continue  # Skip batch and continue training
```

### 4. Code Quality Improvements

#### A. Import Cleanup (`model.py`)
- Removed unused imports (`typing.Union`, `typing.Tuple`, `typing.List`, etc.)
- Fixed conditional imports for optional dependencies
- Added proper error handling for missing modules

#### B. Compatibility Fixes
- Fixed PyTorch version compatibility issues
- Added fallbacks for PyTorch 2.0+ features on older versions
- Resolved Python 3.13 compatibility with torch.compile
